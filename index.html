      	<p>I am a creative, energetic and self-motivated professional in product management with experience in government, startups and corporate organizations. My experience and skill sets are heavily intertwine with my passion for tech. New technologies are reshaping the way we interact and see the world on a daily bases. I am very fortunate to live in the Bay Area to witness and participate in the technological changes. </p>

		    <p>I am well versed and experienced in web product development, email marketing and digital advertising. My past and current roles have allowed me to build everything from green technology models, e-filing systems, and email marketing automation system to new ad products. I consider myself a unique hybrid between a marketer and a product manager. I have the heart of a marketer with the perspective of a product manger. Letâ€™s connect and swap ideas if you are looking for a product manager who thinks with a different perspective.</p>
